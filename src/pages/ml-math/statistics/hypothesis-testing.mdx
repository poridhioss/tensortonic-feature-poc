# Hypothesis Testing

Hypothesis testing is a statistical method for making decisions about populations based on sample data. It's fundamental to A/B testing, model validation, and scientific research.

## The Framework

<Callout type="definition" title="Null and Alternative Hypotheses">
- **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)**: The default assumption (e.g., "there is no effect")
- **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$ or $H_a$)**: What we're trying to prove (e.g., "there is an effect")
</Callout>

## P-Values

<Callout type="definition" title="Definition: P-Value">
The **p-value** is the probability of observing results at least as extreme as the current results, assuming the null hypothesis is true.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" title="Common Misconception">
A p-value is NOT the probability that the null hypothesis is true. It's the probability of seeing the data given that $H_0$ is true.
</Callout>

## Type I and Type II Errors

| | $H_0$ is True | $H_0$ is False |
|---|---|---|
| Reject $H_0$ | Type I Error (α) | Correct |
| Fail to Reject $H_0$ | Correct | Type II Error (β) |

- **Type I Error**: False positive (rejecting a true null hypothesis)
- **Type II Error**: False negative (failing to reject a false null hypothesis)

## Statistical Significance

The significance level $\alpha$ (typically 0.05) is the threshold for rejecting $H_0$:

- If p-value < α → Reject $H_0$
- If p-value ≥ α → Fail to reject $H_0$

<Callout type="tip" title="Remember">
"Statistical significance" doesn't mean "practically important." Always consider effect size alongside p-values.
</Callout>
