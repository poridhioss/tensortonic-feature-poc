# Probability Distributions

A probability distribution describes how the values of a random variable are distributed. Understanding distributions is essential for machine learning, as many algorithms assume specific distributions for data or model parameters.

## Discrete vs Continuous

<Callout type="info" title="Two Types of Distributions">
- **Discrete distributions**: Variables can only take specific values (e.g., number of customers)
- **Continuous distributions**: Variables can take any value within a range (e.g., height, temperature)
</Callout>

## The Normal Distribution

<Callout type="definition" title="Definition: Normal Distribution">
The **normal distribution** (Gaussian distribution) is a continuous probability distribution characterized by its bell-shaped curve. It's defined by two parameters: mean ($\mu$) and standard deviation ($\sigma$).
</Callout>

<Formula name="Normal Distribution PDF">
$$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$$
</Formula>

### Properties

- Symmetric around the mean
- Mean = Median = Mode
- 68% of data falls within 1 standard deviation
- 95% of data falls within 2 standard deviations
- 99.7% of data falls within 3 standard deviations

<Callout type="tip" title="The 68-95-99.7 Rule">
This is also called the **empirical rule** and is crucial for understanding how data spreads in a normal distribution.
</Callout>

## The Binomial Distribution

<Callout type="definition" title="Definition: Binomial Distribution">
The **binomial distribution** models the number of successes in $n$ independent trials, each with probability $p$ of success.
</Callout>

<Formula name="Binomial PMF">
$$P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$$
</Formula>

<Example title="Coin Flips">
What's the probability of getting exactly 3 heads in 5 coin flips?

$n = 5$, $k = 3$, $p = 0.5$

$$P(X = 3) = \binom{5}{3} (0.5)^3 (0.5)^2 = 10 \times 0.125 \times 0.25 = 0.3125$$
</Example>

## The Poisson Distribution

<Callout type="definition" title="Definition: Poisson Distribution">
The **Poisson distribution** models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval, given a known average rate $\lambda$.
</Callout>

<Formula name="Poisson PMF">
$$P(X = k) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}$$
</Formula>

Common applications:
- Number of website visitors per hour
- Number of calls to a call center
- Number of defects in a product
